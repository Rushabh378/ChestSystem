# ChestSystem
creating chest system like Clash of Royals

In Clash Royale, chests are an essential part of the game. They contain valuable items that can help players progress and improve their decks. There are several types of chests available in the game, including free chests, crown chests, and special event chests. Each chest has its unique rewards and can be earned in different ways. For example, free chests are given out to players every few hours, while crown chests are earned by winning battles and earning crowns. The higher the level of the chest, the better the rewards inside, so players should always try to earn the highest level chests possible. Overall, the chest system in Clash Royale is a fun and rewarding way to keep players engaged and motivated to keep playing.

I have created a chest system that mirrors this chest system like an instantiate chest, opening with a timer or with diamonds immediately. if one chest is opening you can't open other chests without opening immediately with diamonds. instead, you can put it in the queue so that when the timer runs out and the chest is open one in the queue starts to open the chest.
